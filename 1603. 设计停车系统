construct the ParkingSystem class:

  1. use ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) to initialize the object of this object;
  2. the number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
  3. use bool addCar(int carType) to check whether there's a parking space of carType for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. 
  4. carType can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by 1, 2, and 3 respectively. 
  5. A car can only park in a parking space of its carType. If there is no space available, return false, else park the car in that size space and return true.
